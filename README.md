   - Ambassadors will be able to seek support from their team leaders while executing the tasks.
  
3. Evaluation:
   - Contribution will be evaluated on a monthly basis; Rewards will be calculated based on the evidence submitted in Ambassadors' monthly Github issues.
   - Submit your contribution by creating an issue on this repository latest by the 5th day of the following month. Any late submission will not be accepted.
